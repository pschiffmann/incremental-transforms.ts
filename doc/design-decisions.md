- The `useContext` hook from react doesn't work for this package because a node has more than one parent, so there could be multiple providers for the same context.
- Trying to mutate a disconnected node fails in the render phase, not the mutate phase. This is to be consistent with the behaviour that first mutating and then disconnecting the same node inside a single transaction also fails during the render phase.
